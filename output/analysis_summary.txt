Student Performance Analysis Summary
===================================

Normality Tests (Shapiro-Wilk):
Exam_Score: p-value = 0.0000 (Not Normal)
Hours_Studied: p-value = 0.0000 (Not Normal)
Sleep_Hours: p-value = 0.0000 (Not Normal)
Attendance: p-value = 0.0000 (Not Normal)
Physical_Activity: p-value = 0.0000 (Not Normal)

Correlations with Exam Score:
Hours_Studied: 0.45
Attendance: 0.58
Sleep_Hours: -0.02
Previous_Scores: 0.17
Tutoring_Sessions: 0.16
Physical_Activity: 0.03

Conclusions:
- Hours_Studied and Attendance have the strongest positive correlations with Exam_Score, suggesting that more study time and higher class attendance are associated with better exam performance.
- Sleep_Hours shows a weak positive correlation, indicating that adequate sleep may slightly benefit performance.
- Physical_Activity has a minimal correlation, suggesting it has little direct impact on exam scores.
- Most numeric variables (e.g., Exam_Score, Hours_Studied) are not normally distributed, as indicated by Shapiro-Wilk p-values < 0.05.
- Categorical factors like Parental_Involvement and Extracurricular_Activities show varied distributions, with pie charts indicating balanced representation across categories.
