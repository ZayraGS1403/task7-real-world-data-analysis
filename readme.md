# Student Performance Factors Analysis Project: Real World Data Analysis

**Student:** Zayra Guti√©rrez Solano

## Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze a real-world dataset on student performance factors, sourced from Kaggle (`StudentPerformanceFactors.csv`). The dataset contains 6,378 student records with features like study hours, attendance, sleep patterns, parental involvement, access to resources, and exam scores. The project involves data cleaning, statistical analysis, visualization, and unit testing to ensure robust analysis, targeting at least 90% test coverage. The focus is on identifying patterns, distributions, and relationships to understand how various factors influence academic outcomes.

### Data Structure
